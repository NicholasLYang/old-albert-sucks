This is a website dedicated to demonstrating how Albert is an absolute atrocity
of web development and design. Albert is not only aesthetically appalling, but
also utterly devoid of sensible UI/UX.

## Why?

Why make this website? As an NYU student and a web programmer, I have to
interact with this abomination of a site throughout the year, all the while
seeing the horrible design choices and decisions. I'm sure I'm not the only one
who is disgusted with Albert. However, I don't think many students truly
understand the extent to which Albert's design is messed up. The goal of this
website is to give a web programmer's view and review of the
various mishaps, bugs and WTFs of Albert.

Don't get me wrong here. I *like* NYU. NYU is a great school, with great
students, great teachers and a great location. It's only due to this greatness
that Albert's...well lack of greatness is so jarring. I hope that
this blog can help make NYU an even better school for even better students.

## About The Site

This site is powered by Jekyll, a great blog engine written in Ruby. The font is
Merriweather, provided by Google Fonts. I might rewrite the blog in something
more involved, such as React, but that requires more time commitment than I'm
willing to provide.
